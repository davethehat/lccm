'use strict';

// This is a comment... use sparingly

// Look up 'use strict'. Why do we use it? Why wouldn't you?


// ===================

// A program is a series of statements.
// Statements are terminated with ";".
// Here are some amazing facts about statements...


console.log('2 + 3 = ' + (2 + 3));

// "let" introduces a special kind of statement, a declaration
let sum = 2 + 3;
console.log('2 + 3 (still) = ' + sum);

// Expressions are statements when terminated
sum = sum * sum;
console.log('Squaring it gives us ' + sum);

// You can write an empty statement...

;  // nothing to see here
;
;
;  // these are not the statements you are looking for

// You can write several statements on one line...
console.log(1); console.log(2); console.log(3);
// ... but it's considered bad style. Why, do you think?

// You can omit the ";" -- in most cases -- at the end of a line which contains only only statement:
console.log('please')
console.log('do')
console.log('not')
console.log('do')
console.log('this...')
// ... but again, it's considered bad style. Why, do you think?


// Write a few statements below using console.log to display the text
// 
// It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
// During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
// Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy....


console.log("It is a period of civil war.");
